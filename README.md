# Encoding-Progress
A repository for me to dump my encoding scripts. Both as reference and to track improvement in the horrid things I do to video

## So what's the point? ##
Basically not keeping everything on my disc endlessly. And I like seeing how I improve over time.
As I get better, this stuff will slowly become a nice basic reference for me to get an idea how to handle a source and where to improve. And it's also something for me to get back to a source with some time and improve at least the scripts.

## You're a shit encoder! ##
I know I am, thanks Cpt. Obvious! That said, feel free to shoot in a PR if you see any room for improvement. When you do, please give me a heads up on how it's an improvement and what additional requirements I need for the script to run.

# Directories #
These names should be pretty self-explanatory, but you never know.
| Folder | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Dropped | This was too much for me. Or at least for now. I might get back to it later, but as-is I will not encode any episodes for it. Things like OPs, EDs and the scenes for insert songs may still be filtered out for [AMQ](https://animemusicquiz.com) |
| Completed | Hooray! I've encoded everything for this source! Or at least I wrote all the scripts and came out ~~sane~~ alive on the other end. |
| Ongoing | I'm still working on this and hope it will one day move to Completed. ~~Dropped is still an option though~~ |
| Misc. | Random stuff I do for other people, most will be (NC)OPs/EDs or video for cleaning insert songs in anime. These end up in AMQ. These won't get added to Completed because I won't have the full source for it. Otherwise it will first move to Ongoing |
